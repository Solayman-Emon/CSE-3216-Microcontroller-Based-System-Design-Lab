## Overview

Environmental pollution mainly caused for littering is as old as the civilization itself. It has become a major concern in the
last few decades. It is the by product of the development of civilization and in fact a price for the progress. It is more
prone in case of Bangladesh. People throw trash everywhere and this tendency is very harmful. So we have decided to make a 
smart dustbin which people can easily use to throw trash and that will help to reduce the harm. Basically it will be an easily
accessible dustbin. For more details please visit [here](https://github.com/Solayman-Emon/CSE-3216-Microcontroller-Based-System-Design-Lab/blob/master/Facilitated_Smart_Dustbin/Proposals/Final_Project_Proposal.pdf).
