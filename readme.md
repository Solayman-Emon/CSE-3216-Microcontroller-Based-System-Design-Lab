## Overview

Environmental pollution manly caused for littering is as old as the civilization itself. It has become a major concern in the
last few decades. It is the by product of the development of civilization and in fact a price for the progress. It is more
prone in case of Bangladesh. People throw trash everywhere and this tendency is very harmful. So we have decided to make a 
smart dustbin which people can easily use to throw trash and that will help to reduce the harm. Basically it will be an easily
accessible dustbin.
